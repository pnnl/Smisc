\title{2-step Chebyshev outlier detection}
\description{
Uses a 2-step (unimodal and/or one-sided) Chebyshev outlier detection to
identify outliers or unusual values.
}
\usage{
cheb.2step.od(the.vector, unimodal = TRUE, first.rejval = 1/1000,
              second.rejvals = c(1/100, 1/1000, 1/10000),
              do.plot = FALSE, zero.var.correction = TRUE, one.sided = NULL, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{the.vector}{Vector of numeric data}
  \item{unimodal}{\code{=TRUE} assumes the data come from a unimodal
  distribution}
  \item{first.rejval}{A numerical probability cutoff value used to
    identify the initial Chebyshev limits that will filter the data for
    the calculation of the second step Chebyshev limits}
  \item{second.rejvals}{A vector of probability cutoff values that are
    used in the second application of the Chebychev filter}
  \item{do.plot}{\code{=TRUE} produces a histogram that shows the data,
    the first step Chebyshev limit in gray and the second Chebyshev
    limits in blue.}
  \item{zero.var.correction}{\code{=TRUE} ensures that the filtered data
    set (used for the second step) does not have zero variance.  See
    Details.}
  \item{one.sided}{if "upper" (or "lower"), it calculates a one-sided
    upper (or lower) Chebyshev
    limit (in both steps) instead of the usual two-sided limit.
    Defaults to \code{NULL}, which produces the two-sided limit.}
  \item{\dots}{Additional arguments to \code{\link{my.histogram}}}
}
\details{
In the first step, the Chebyshev
limit is used to filter gross outliers from the data.  The filtered data are
then used to estimate the mean and standard deviation that are used to
contruct the Chebyshev limits during the second step.  This way, the
estimates of the mean and standard deviation are not unduly influenced
by large outliers.

When \code{zero.variance.correction=TRUE}, outliers identified on
the first pass are set equal to the first Chebyshev limit (instead of being
removed) if removing those outliers creates a filtered data vector
that has 0 variance.  This ensures that the filtered data
set (used for the second step) does not have zero variance.

\value{
  A list with the following components
  \item{output}{A matrix with the requested second step probabilities
    and the second step Chebyshev limits}
  \item{removed.in.step1}{Shows the data points that were filtered and
    not used in calculating the Chebyshev limits in step 2}
  \item{step1.cv}{A matrix with the requested first step probabilities
    and the first step Chebyshev limits}
